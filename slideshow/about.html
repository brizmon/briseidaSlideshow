			<p>frank is a partnership born of a love for each other, our children, and the possibility of the printed word, engraved image, and graphic design. It is the story of an Art History major who connected with an English major, traversed the terrain of graduate school and big business, nonprofit work and public education, to arrive at the realization that what we can do together far outweighs anything we could do apart. </p><br>
			<p>We believe in the importance of communication and connection, and we know you have something important to say. At frank shop we believe that personalization is powerful and fun. We started our shop as a family, as an extension of our interests in printing, engraving, photography, and fiber arts. We develop the products and strive to produce items that are fun and meaningful.</p><br>
			<p>We welcome your ideas and questions and we look forward to producing your ideas in ink, engraving your ideas in wood, and helping you say what you want to say. Thank you for visiting frank shop. Best wishes for a wonderful day!</p>
